# AWS-Pipeline-for-Dimensional-Modeling

### **Project Overview:**  
1. **Developed an End-to-End AWS Data Pipeline** – Designed and implemented a scalable data pipeline using **AWS Glue, AWS S3, AWS Athena, and AWS Lambda** for efficient data ingestion, transformation, and querying.  
2. **Automated Data Processing & Storage** – Utilized **AWS Glue ETL** jobs to clean and transform raw data before storing it in an optimized **Parquet format** in S3.  
3. **Enabled SQL-Based Analytics with AWS Athena** – Leveraged **AWS Athena** to perform serverless querying on large datasets, reducing infrastructure management overhead.  
4. **Optimized Performance & Cost Efficiency** – Implemented partitioning and compression techniques to enhance query performance and minimize AWS costs.  

### **Project Outcome:**  
- Successfully built a serverless and cost-effective **big data analytics pipeline** using AWS services.  
- Reduced query latency with **optimized storage formats (Parquet) and partitioning** in Athena.  
- Enabled real-time and ad-hoc analytics on structured and semi-structured datasets.
